# Club-Connect - OneStop for Clubs
- Developed a web application that displays the recent postings published by Gymkhana Clubs on their separate Facebook sites, and important information about future events & meetings, all in a user-friendly interface.
- Used Selenium-Python for scraping Facebook feeds, Django for the backend, and implemented different social logins.
